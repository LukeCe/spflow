\description{
Compute the moment expression in an interaction model in matrix form
}
\details{
The moment (U'U) moment matrix is grouped into (4x4) blocks.
These 16 blocks are derived as interactions from the four blocks
{alpha, alpha_I, beta, gamma}.
Only ten blocks are unique and the remaining six are inferred by symmetry.
The developments follow the theory presented in
