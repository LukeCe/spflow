The [**spflow**](https://lukece.github.io/spflow/) package allows to estimate spatial econometric interaction models.
It is designed to exploit the relational structure of flow data, reducing the computational burden and memory requirements.

## Installation

You can install the released version of spflow from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spflow) with:

``` r
install.packages("spflow")
```

And the  development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LukeCe/spflow")
```

## Example

The package provides a new `spflow_multinet-class` that combines information on the origins, the destinations, and the origin-destination pairs.
Once this object is created, we can estimate an interaction model with the `spflow()` function. 
The [package vignette](https://lukece.github.io/spflow/articles/paris_commute_flows.html) contains a more detailed example.


```{r, message=FALSE}
library("spflow")
data("multi_net_usa_ge")

spflow(y9 ~ O_(X) + D_(X) + I(X) + G_(DISTANCE), multi_net_usa_ge)
```
